Drop this script on your page and it will build you a beautiful widget
that displays the status of your WordPress plugin.

Something like this:

## How do I use it?

Everwhere you want a widget to be placed, add the following markup:

	<div class="wordpress-widget" data-slug="slug-of-your-plugin"></div>

Then include the javascript file somewhere after you've include jQuery:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.WordPressPluginWidget.js"></script>

That's it!
