## How do I use it?

Everwhere you want a widget to be placed, add the following markup:

	<div class="github-widget" data-repo="JoelSutherland/GitHub-jQuery-Repo-Widget"></div>

Then include the javascript file somewhere after you've include jQuery:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.githubRepoWidget.min.js"></script>

That's it! All of the styling is included and image assets are pulled from GitHub.
